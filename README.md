===============================================================================

## Description

Tornado-cli is a command line tool for Tornado.

## Instructions

There is currently only a single command:

startproject

Usage:

tcli startproject project_name

or

tornado-cli startproject project_name

This creates a project directory called project_name, and creates a file
structure for the project.  The output is from [tornado-boilerplate](https://github.com/beardygeek/tornado-boilerplate).
